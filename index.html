<h1>Portfolio</h1>

Hey there! My name is Kanishk Dendukuri and this is my portfolio. Below you will see highlights of my projects. I was first exposed to programming when I was in middle school where I made two player scratch games. In 10th grade, I took AP Computer Science A, in which I learned java and worked on a project at the end of the class. In 2020, as a junior, I took iOS Development and developed several games. In 12th grade, 2022, I am taking Advanced iOS App Development to learn more advanced game development and am working on a game with my friends.


# iOS App Development

I started the class with no prior knowledge in Swift, but I did have experience with developing in other languages such as c++, python, and java. So I decided to make a simple game. In the procces of making the game I learned a lot about spriteKit. The game was very simple, the player has to dodge the astroids for as long as they can. I also incorperated a highscore that stores on the devide and even had music. [Astroid Dodge](https://github.com/kanthecalc/SpaceKan)

After learning some basic spritekit I decided to work on a level based platformer with a couple of my friends. The game is called [Astro Portal](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Astro-Portal). Astro Portal is a platformer on the [iOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/bz/app/astro-portal/id1558706324). It is avaiable for iPhone, iPad, and has keyboard control support for macs with Apple Silicon chips. While making the game I learned how design levels in such a way that it maximizes the game mechanics. We also released two additional updates after the initial release on the App Store where we fixed bugs, reworked movement mechinacs to be more user-friendly, added a personal best system, and a launch trailer.

The next game I worked on is called [Spelunk Knight](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/knight). Spelunk Knight a metroidvania where the player has to explore the map to find abilities to be able to reach other parts of the map. While developing the game I learned how to create animated art. This was a big step for me because I didnt have any expirence with art before. Another thing I learned while learning is game design and how to make a large map while still making it entertaining. We were also able to get this app into the [app store](https://apps.apple.com/tt/app/spelunk-knight/id1612481607) and is avaiable for iPhone, iPad.

# Java

After learning java for almost 4 months, my friends and I decided to develop a game using java awt and jpanel. We decided to make a shooting game called [GETAWAY](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-mario/) where players run and dodge bullets and obstacles and try to make it into the getaway car. Laser shooting desert rangers and awfully fast chickens guest star.

# Scratch

I first started learing programming with a simple two player car racing game called [CarRace](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/163303345/). In the game players race around a small track to get to the finish line first. If a player goes outside the track they get reset back to the start.

After getting used to scrtach I decided to make a two player coop pacman game named [pac man-10](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/164566851/) where a player can choose between single player and coop mode with the goal of eating all the green dots before the enimies kill you. It even has multiple levels.
